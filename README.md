## USER STORY

AS A USER, I am collecting coding resources from many different sources and sites across the internet.

AS A USER, I am an active member of the developer community online and want to contribute help to other devs.

I WANT an easy-to-use application that I can upload resources to save for later viewing, while also contributing to the

collection of resources in the developer community. 

SO THAT I can continue to upskill my coding skills, and contribute to the upskilling of my new community.
